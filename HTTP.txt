HTTP -> Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.

=> It is an application layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.
It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. 

=> HTTP follows a classical client-server model, 

=> HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests. 
means as soon as the client receives the response Http disconnect itself from the server. 

=> HTTP is a client-server Protocol.

=> Between the client and the server there are numerous entities, collectively called proxies,
which perform different operations and act as caches or gateways.

=> When a client wants to communicate with a server, either the final server or intermediate proxy
it performs the following steps:

1. ⁡⁣⁣⁢Open a TCP connection⁡: A TCP connection is used to send a request and receive an answer. 

2. ⁡⁣⁣⁢Send an HTTP message⁡: HTTP messages before HTTP/2 are human-readable. 
with HTTP/2, these simple messages are encapsulted in frames, making them impossible to read directly.



# ⁡⁣⁢⁣HTTP Resources⁡ 

=> The target of an HTTP request is called a "resource", whose nature isn't defined further
it can be a document, a photo, or anything else. 
Each resource is identified by a uniform resource identifier. 

=> ⁡⁣⁣⁢The most common form of URI is the Uniform Resource Locator(URL).⁡ which is known as web address.

ex-> http://www.example.com:80/path/to/myfile.html?Key1=value1&key2=value2

=> In above example (http://) is the protocol. It indicates which protocol the browser must use. 
Usually it is the HTTP protocol or its secured version, HTTPS.

=> The web requires one of these two, but it also know how to handle other protocols such as FTP, SMTP and so on. 

=> In above example (www.example.com) means Domain name. 

=> (:80) is a port no. It indicates the technical gate used to access the resources on the web server. 

=> /path/file.html is the path to the resources on the web server. 

=> (?Key=value1&key2=value2) are the query parameters that are used by web server to do extra stuff before returning the resource to the user. 


# ⁡⁣⁢⁣HTTP Messages⁡

=> HTTP Methods (GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, Delete)
