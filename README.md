# NodeJS 

-> Node js is a runtime environment of javascript. 

-> It is built on top of Chromium(V8 engine) and C++.

-> V8 engine has an ability to compile and execute js. 

-> The V8 engine is not fully embedded to C++. The DOM & Windows related stuff is removed from V8 while embedding with C++.

->  A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. 

-> Node.js uses event driven-architecture, non-blocking I/O model to handle concurrent request with single thread. 

-> Build apps with node.js like Netflix, chatApp, paymentsApp, RestApi and so on. 

# Nodejs vs Browser

-> With Browser we have access to DOM, Web API where as with Node.js we have modules provide to access to file system, OS. 


-> Node.js supports both the commonJS(require()) and ES module systems (import)
